To execute this machine learning algorithm initialize the optimized_airport_traffic_predictor.py program


Development: When initially writing this script it went through several iterations focusing on different qualities
             that could be used to predict if an airport would attract significant traffic.
             Initially the model had assumed that the amount of routes that went in an out of an airport contributed
             to traffic but this seemed rather unrefined and doesn't necessarily glean any valuable insights.
             It also contributed to a rather messy 1000 line script which was difficult to work with.

             I had decided that the best course of action was to remove any factors that didn't significantly contribute
             to the valuation things like coastline proximity and the population surrounding the airport (which is an interesting insight)
             that way it'd be significantly more efficient. Though this model also runs into problems with R^2 accuracy dropping
             from 95% to 86.1% which is disappointing. Trying to work with this new script was ultimately frustrating,
             so I moved back to iterating on features.

             The script needed significant organizational fixes that take up the majority of my time.
