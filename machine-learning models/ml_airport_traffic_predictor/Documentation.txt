To execute this machine learning algorithm initialize the optimized_airport_traffic_predictor.py program


Development: When initially writing this script it went through several iterations focusing on different qualities
             that could be used to predict if an airport would attract significant traffic.
             Initially the model had assumed that the amount of routes that went in an out of an airport contributed
             to traffic but this seemed rather unrefined and doesn't necessarily glean any valuable insights.
             It also contributed to a rather messy 1000 line script which was difficult to work with.
             I changed the Hub functions to be more in-depth which got RÂ² Score: 0.95 = 95% accuracy.

             The script needed significant organizational fixes that take up the majority of my time.
             Which were finally completed at 04:44.
